Some scenes are hard and tricky to play and win. Be notice!
Unfortunately, if you caused a bug which frozen or cannot move or close the game, you will have to play it from beginning (Chapter 1). We'll fix that in the following patch.

Here are some tips about every chapter:
- Chapter 1: Easy, just choose what shown on the screen and continue.
- Chapter 2: Intermediate, control your character using W, A, S, D keyboard (no jump allowed). Be careful not to fall out of the terrain.
- Chapter 3: Hard, the Pong Game requires you to focus and calculate the move of the ball to not let it goes across you. You have to beat 3 points for getting to next Chapter.
- Chapter 4: (4.1 & 4.2) Hard, play same like Temple Run. (Tricks: Double-space for higher jump in short distance. Hold-space for higher jump in long distance)
- Chapter 5: Easy, you have reached the last chapter, just follow the HUD (Heads Up Display).
