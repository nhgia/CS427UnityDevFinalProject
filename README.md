#### Brief introduction of game
 A boy who have a family like others. His mother died from long time
ago. He continued to move on, bad things and good things happened. One day,
he was hit by a car. In the frontier of live and death, he have to choose his own
destiny. <br/>
At a very moment of time, he will be memorized what reminiscence he have
forgotten in the past. These memories will help him get a better decision. <br/>
To live or to die, some people said that it was destiny while some think you can
make yours… Who know...

#### How to install
Go to ./Build/ and download subfolder matched with your platform (Windows or macOS).

#### How to play
> “Life is miserable, fun, sad and happy at the same time. How you die is
how the life affect you and how you live is how you treat the life.” <br/>

You will be played as a boy who have a family. Use the character to
discover more about his life-memory which was forgotten. You can decide the
story in which you want it to happen. <br/>
Our game use First-person view so use key W, A, S, D for control the
character to move forward, left, backward, right. In some scenes, you will force to
play some 2D-based game for regenerating character’s memory. It is fine to win
or lose the game because every result you get caught you a different memory.

#### Game demo & Walkthrough

Check out the link https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/14n1m-VSLmo_-RcOMRcjXer5vs1shM2v1 for demo and walkthrough.
Some scenes are hard and tricky to play and win. Be notice! <br/>
Unfortunately, if you caused a bug which frozen or cannot move or close the game, you will have to play it from beginning (Chapter 1). We'll fix that in the following patch.

Here are some tips about every chapter:
- Chapter 1: Easy, just choose what shown on the screen and continue.
- Chapter 2: Intermediate, control your character using W, A, S, D keyboard (no jump allowed). Be careful not to fall out of the terrain.
- Chapter 3: Hard, the Pong Game requires you to focus and calculate the move of the ball to not let it goes across you. You have to beat 3 points for getting to next Chapter.
- Chapter 4: (4.1 & 4.2) Hard, play same like Temple Run. (Tricks: Double-space for higher jump in short distance. Hold-space for higher jump in long distance)
- Chapter 5: Easy, you have reached the last chapter, just follow the HUD (Heads Up Display).
