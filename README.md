 A boy who have a family like others. His mother died from long time
ago. He continued to move on, bad things and good things happened. One day,
he was hit by a car. In the frontier of live and death, he have to choose his own
destiny. <br/>
At a very moment of time, he will be memorized what reminiscence he have

#### How to play
> “Life is miserable, fun, sad and happy at the same time. How you die is
how the life affect you and how you live is how you treat the life.” <br/>

You will be played as a boy who have a family. Use the character to
discover more about his life-memory which was forgotten. You can decide the
story in which you want it to happen. <br/>
Our game use First-person view so use key W, A, S, D for control the
character to move forward, left, backward, right. In some scenes, you will force to
play some 2D-based game for regenerating character’s memory. It is fine to win
